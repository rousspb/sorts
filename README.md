This project was created to understand different kind of sort methods in javaScript.
Every file contains a different method.
My idea is only to provide a way to implement each of the existing methods. It was never intended as the best of an implementation.

## Table of sorts methods.

- Bubble
- Insertion
- Insertion sort in place
- Merge sort using recursion 
- Quick sort
- Selection sort
- Selection sort in place
